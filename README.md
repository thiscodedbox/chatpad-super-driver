#### Original Project Information

>This project aims to provide drivers and utilities to provide unofficial support for the Microsoft XBox 360 controller chatpad under various Windows operating systems.  The chatpad is a small keyboard that attaches to a controller, but Microsoft has not released Windows drivers.  Thus, this project exists to provide a solution.
>
>Currently, only wired controllers are supported.  Future plans include investigating support for wireless XBox 360 controllers.

#### ThisCodedBox Goals and Additions

Configured driver package to function on **Windows 10 x64**
- Small changes to .inf files to allow catalog files to be built
- Instructions for driver signing

# CAUTION

This will tell you to create your own signed drivers and install them - if you don't understand why this is sketchy, look into it before attempting to follow these instructions.
