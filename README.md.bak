# Original Project Information #

This project aims to provide drivers and utilities to provide unofficial support for the Microsoft XBox 360 controller chatpad under various Windows operating systems.  The chatpad is a small keyboard that attaches to a controller, but Microsoft has not released Windows drivers.  Thus, this project exists to provide a solution.

Currently, only wired controllers are supported.  Future plans include investigating support for wireless XBox 360 controllers.
